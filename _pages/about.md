<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Hello there, my name is Carlos, and I'm a PhD and Electrical Civil Engineer with a strong interest in Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and Teaching. My career has been developed around high-technology and innovation-driven projects involving automation systems in medicine, mining, and retail. My PhD thesis focused on detecting complex patterns using colour and texture features, integrating statistical modeling, machine learning, and computer vision techniques.</div>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: justify;">  In recent years, I have gained experience in full-cycle data science projects, from gathering and preprocessing large volumes of structured and unstructured data, to developing and deploying machine learning models. I’m proficient in Python and R, and I write production-ready code that is maintainable and testable. My work spans specialized AI areas such as Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Generative AI. I’m also well-versed in model evaluation, optimization, and interpreting results using visualization tools to extract actionable insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I maintain a strong commitment to ethical standards and data privacy in every project I undertake.</div>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: justify;">  Besides my project-oriented work, I have dedicated a significant portion of my career to teaching. Over the years, I have had the privilege of instructing diverse courses, ranging from fundamental mathematics and physics to specialized subjects within electrical engineering. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise in image processing and associated laboratories. My commitment to education extends beyond the traditional classroom, and I am passionate about fostering a dynamic learning environment that encourages curiosity and critical thinking among students.</div>
