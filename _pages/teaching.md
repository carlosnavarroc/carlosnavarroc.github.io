## Teaching
- **Institution:** University of Chile - U. Santo Tomás - U. Andrés Bello
- **Position:** Professor
- **Duration:** 2015 - Present
- _One of my great passions is teaching. Since my mother and father are teachers, getting other human beings to participate actively in their learning is challenging_
- **Description:** During these years, I have taught several courses, from fundamental mathematics and physics to those related to my electrical engineering expertise, such as [image processing](https://tinyurl.com/Clases-CNC-Imagenes) or [related laboratories](https://www.die.cl/academicos-jornada-parcial/).

## Thesis Committee Member or Advisor

- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
  - As advisor:
    - *Transformer-type neural networks for classifying HER2 protein overexpression in gastric cancer biopsy images.* (2023). **Author: Diego Muñoz. DIE.** This study focuses on enhancing gastric cancer diagnosis accuracy through transformer-type neural networks compared to convolutional networks. The transformer model demonstrates superior performance over the CNN, achieving higher accuracy and f1-score in classifying all classes of HER2 protein overexpression.

    - *Automated diagnosis of glaucoma using Machine Learning tools applied to Chromatic Pupilometry data.* (2024). **Author: Manuel Zamorano. DIE.** In progress. [Link Thesis]()
  - As co-advisor:
    - *Monitoring calving events through processing images* (2024). **Author: Catalina Zapata.  DIE-Geophysics.** In progress. [Link Thesis]()
    - *Prediction of cognitive decline functional in older patients based on clinical history (texts) and machine learning* (2024). **Author: Alvaro Gallardo.  Master of Data Science.** In progress. [Link Thesis]()
  - As a committee member:
    - *Development of an intelligent image recognition engine for last-mile dispatch test photos.*  (2023). **Author: Franco Mirauda. DIE.** This work proposes a smart image recognition engine that allows evaluating the quality of last-mile dispatches by reviewing some aspects of the photograph taken at the moment of product delivery.
