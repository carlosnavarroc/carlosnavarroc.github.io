Social isolation and loneliness represent distinct but closely related psychosocial constructs that have gained increased relevance in the context of population aging and the COVID-19 pandemic. Social isolation refers to having minimal contact with family, friends, or social networks, whereas loneliness reflects the subjective experience of insufficient emotional closeness and perceived lack of meaningful relationships.

This cross-sectional descriptive study investigates the psychological impact of social isolation, perceived loneliness, and pandemic-related concerns on depressive symptoms in older adults in Chile. A total of 150 participants were assessed using validated psychosocial measures, allowing for the examination of interrelations among these variables and the identification of sex-specific patterns.

Results revealed significant associations between social isolation, loneliness, and depressive symptoms, even after the most restrictive phases of the pandemic had ended. Notably, sex differences emerged in how these factors were experienced and related to mental health outcomes, suggesting differentiated vulnerability pathways among older men and women.

These findings underscore the persistent psychological consequences of social disconnection and subjective loneliness in later life. The study highlights the importance of addressing both objective and subjective dimensions of social relationships in mental health interventions and public health strategies aimed at older populations, particularly in post-pandemic contexts.
