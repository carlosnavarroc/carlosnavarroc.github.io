This paper explores the connection between cochlear dysfunction and the risk of cognitive decline in older adults with normal hearing or mild hearing loss. The authors propose using otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) as a sensitive tool to estimate said risk. The results suggest that DPOAEs could be an early non-invasive biomarker to detect neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in the early stages.
