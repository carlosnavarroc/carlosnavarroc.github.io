This study analyzes the effects of social isolation and the perception of loneliness in self-sufficient older adults living in Santiago, Chile, in the post-pandemic context (March–November 2022). Using validated instruments—such as the Steptoe Social Isolation Index, the Three-Item UCLA Loneliness Scale, and the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)—the research explores gender-based differences and correlations with psychiatric symptoms, as well as concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings provide key insights into social vulnerability and mental health outcomes among older adults.
