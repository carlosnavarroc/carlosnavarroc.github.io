<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>Hello there, my name is Carlos, and I'm a PhD and Electrical Civil Engineer with a strong interest in Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and Teaching. My career has focused on high-technology, innovation-driven projects involving automation systems in medicine, mining, and retail.</p>

  <p>In these projects, I’ve applied techniques from statistical modeling, machine learning, and computer vision. My PhD research focused on detecting complex patterns using colour and texture features — work that laid the foundation for my transition into data science and AI.</p>

  <p>More recently, I’ve led full-cycle data science projects: collecting and preprocessing large datasets, building and deploying machine learning models, and interpreting results for stakeholders. I write production-ready code in Python and R, and have hands-on experience in areas like NLP, computer vision, and Generative AI. I also bring a strong awareness of model evaluation, ethical AI, and data privacy.</p>

  <p>Alongside technical work, I’ve devoted much of my career to teaching. I’ve taught everything from foundational math and physics to advanced electrical engineering topics. I enjoy sharing knowledge — especially in image processing — and strive to create engaging learning environments that foster curiosity and critical thinking.</p>
