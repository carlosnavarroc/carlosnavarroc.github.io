This paper presents VolumePeeler, a flexible FIJI plugin designed for the virtual peeling of 3D image stacks using both spherical and spline-based surface projections. The tool was applied successfully on images of spherical embryos as well as non-spherical tissue layers. By virtually removing outer layers of complex biological volumes, VolumePeeler enhances visualization and enables improved quantitative analysis of microscopy datasets with intricate geometric structures.
