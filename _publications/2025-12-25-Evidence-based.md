Depression is a major public health concern among older adults and represents a relevant risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Building on previous findings from a post-pandemic Chilean cohort, this study develops evidence-based, sex-sensitive therapeutic protocols aimed at reducing psychosocial risk factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease.

The analysis integrates psychosocial and demographic variables, including social isolation, perceived loneliness, pandemic-related concern, and depressive symptoms. Results revealed marked sex-specific patterns: among women, depression was strongly associated with emotional reactivity to loneliness and concern, whereas among men, depressive symptoms were more closely linked to age-related changes and reduced social networks following retirement.

Based on these findings, tailored intervention strategies were proposed. For women, approaches emphasizing emotional support, peer networks, resilience training, group therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and intergenerational programs were identified as particularly effective. For men, structured and goal-oriented interventions—such as volunteer programs, mentorship opportunities, and skill-based group activities—were highlighted as key mechanisms to rebuild social roles and promote instrumental coping styles.

These sex-specific therapeutic protocols underscore the importance of personalized psychosocial interventions in reducing depressive symptoms, enhancing well-being, and potentially lowering long-term risks associated with cognitive decline and dementia. The integration of these strategies into public health initiatives may contribute to more effective and sustainable mental health and dementia prevention policies.
