## Teaching
- **Institution:** University of Chile - U. Santo Tomás - U. Andrés Bello
- **Position:** Professor
- **Duration:** 2015 - Present
- _One of my great passions is teaching. Since my mother and father are teachers, getting other human beings to participate actively in their learning is challenging_
- **Description:** During these years, I have taught several courses, from fundamental mathematics and physics to those related to my electrical engineering expertise, such as [image processing](https://tinyurl.com/Clases-CNC-Imagenes) or [related laboratories](https://www.die.cl/academicos-jornada-parcial/).

## Thesis Committee Member or Advisor

- **Description:**
  - As advisor:
    - Thesis: *Transformer-type neural networks for classifying HER2 protein overexpression in gastric cancer biopsy images.* Author: Diego Muñoz. This study focuses on enhancing gastric cancer diagnosis accuracy through transformer-type neural networks compared to convolutional networks. The transformer model demonstrates superior performance over the CNN, achieving higher accuracy and f1-score in classifying all classes of HER2 protein overexpression.

  - As a committee member:
    - Thesis: *Development of an intelligent image recognition engine for last-mile dispatch test photos.* Author: Franco Mirauda. In this work, a smart image recognition engine is proposed, which allows evaluation of the quality of last-mile dispatches by reviewing some aspects of the photograph taken at the moment of product delivery.

    - Thesis: *Detection and estimation of portion for granular ingredients.* Author: Gonzalo Hernández. This study aims to detect and estimate the portion of granular ingredients in Pizza Hut kitchen images using different models, including Yolov6, Faster R-CNN, SAM, MIM, and BinsFormers.
