- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
- **Position:** Research Assistant
- **Duration:** 2009 - 2018
- **Caption:** In my first experiences, I worked on projects related to automation and image processing in retail and mining, even visiting Teck Highland Valley Copper Mine in Kamloops, Canada, to supervise an installation

### Education

- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2020
- **Position:** PhD in Electrical Engineering 
- **Quote:** Thesis: Color–Texture Pattern Classification Using Global–Local Feature Extraction, an SVM Classifier, with Bagging Ensemble Post-Processing
- **Description:**
  This research provides a new way to attack the classification problem using colour and texture and evidence about the importance of using different scales when obtaining the features to integrate the colour and texture information. The results of this investigation led to two publications: a [conference article](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.562) and a [magazine article](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9153130).

- **Institution:** Faculty of Medicine. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2019
- **Position:** Diploma of Technology in Electrophysiology
- **Quote:** A first approach to biology and medicine from an engineering point of view.
- **Description:** Processing of bioelectric signals and Electrophysiology of Sensory Systems. Final Work: Theoretical analysis of an electrophysiological signal for clinical use and proposal for clinical application.

- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2010
- **Position:** PhD in Electrical Engineering 
- **Quote:** Thesis: Molds design for iris detection through Particle Swarm Optimization
- **Description:** Two methodologies were proposed to create templates for iris localization: one made by hand and the other generated by PSO. The PSO methodology uses templates that are not based on anthropometric information but automatically capture the eye's main features and allow better localization of the iris.

### Thesis Committee Member or Advisor

- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2023
- **Position:** Thesis in Electrical Engineering 
- **Description:**
  - As advisor:
    - Thesis: *Transformer-type neural networks for classifying HER2 protein overexpression in gastric cancer biopsy images.* Author: Diego Muñoz. This study focuses on enhancing gastric cancer diagnosis accuracy through transformer-type neural networks compared to convolutional networks. The transformer model demonstrates superior performance over the CNN, achieving higher accuracy and f1-score in classifying all classes of HER2 protein overexpression.

  - As a committee member:
    - Thesis: *Development of an intelligent image recognition engine for last-mile dispatch test photos.* Author: Franco Mirauda. In this work, a smart image recognition engine is proposed, which allows evaluation of the quality of last-mile dispatches by reviewing some aspects of the photograph taken at the moment of product delivery.
