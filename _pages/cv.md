# Education

## PhD in Electrical Engineering (2020)
- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2020
- **Quote:** Thesis: Color–Texture Pattern Classification Using Global–Local Feature Extraction, an SVM Classifier, with Bagging Ensemble Post-Processing
- **Description:**
  This research provides a new way to attack the classification problem using colour and texture and evidence about the importance of using different scales when obtaining the features to integrate the colour and texture information. The results of this investigation led to two publications: a [conference article](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.562) and a [magazine article](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9153130).

## Diploma of Technology in Electrophysiology (2019)
- **Institution:** Faculty of Medicine. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2019
- **Position:** 
- **Quote:** A first approach to biology and medicine from an engineering point of view.
- **Description:** Processing of bioelectric signals and Electrophysiology of Sensory Systems. Final Work: Theoretical analysis of an electrophysiological signal for clinical use and proposal for clinical application.

## Electrical Engineering (2010) 
- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics. University of Chile.
- **Caption:** 2010
- **Quote:** Thesis: Molds design for iris detection through Particle Swarm Optimization
- **Description:** Two methodologies were proposed to create templates for iris localization: one made by hand and the other generated by PSO. The PSO methodology uses templates that are not based on anthropometric information but automatically capture the eye's main features and allow better localization of the iris.
