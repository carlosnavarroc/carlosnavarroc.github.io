# Education

## PhD in Electrical Engineering (2020)
- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics, University of Chile  
- **Thesis:** [Color–Texture Pattern Classification Using Global–Local Feature Extraction, an SVM Classifier, with Bagging Ensemble Post-Processing](https://www.cec.uchile.cl/~canavarr/Tesis/Navarro_2020.pdf)  
- **Description:**  
  This research proposed a novel approach to classification problems using color and texture features, highlighting the importance of multiscale feature extraction to integrate color and texture information effectively. The results led to two publications: a [conference article](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.562) and a [journal article](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9153130).

## Diploma of Technology in Electrophysiology (2019)
- **Institution:** Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile  
- **Description:**  
  Specialized in bioelectric signal processing and electrophysiology of sensory systems. Final work involved a theoretical analysis of an electrophysiological signal for clinical use and a proposal for clinical application.

## Electrical Engineering (2010)
- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics, University of Chile  
- **Thesis:** [Molds design for iris detection through Particle Swarm Optimization](https://www.cec.uchile.cl/~canavarr/Tesis/Navarro_2010.pdf)  
- **Description:**  
  Proposed two methodologies to create templates for iris localization: a handcrafted approach and an automated method using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The PSO method generates templates independent of anthropometric data and captures key eye features for improved iris detection accuracy.
