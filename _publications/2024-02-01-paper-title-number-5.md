title: "VolumePeeler: a novel FIJI plugin for geometric tissue peeling to improve visualization and quantification of 3D image stacks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-07-12-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper introduces VolumePeeler, a versatile FIJI plugin designed for virtual 3D "peeling" of image stacks. The plugin incorporates spherical and spline surface projections, and we utilized it to conduct peeling on 3D images of both spherical embryos and non-spherical tissue layers. The resulting images enhance the visualization of 3D volumes, facilitating the analysis and quantification of microscopy datasets with complex geometric structures.'
