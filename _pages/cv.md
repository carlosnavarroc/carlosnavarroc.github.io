Education
======

### Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering - University of Chile

- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics, University of Chile.
- **Year:** 2020.
- **Thesis:** [Color–Texture Pattern Classification Using Global–Local Feature Extraction, an SVM Classifier, with Bagging Ensemble Post-Processing](https://www.cec.uchile.cl/~canavarr/Tesis/Navarro_2020.pdf).

#### Thesis Highlights:
- Introduced a new approach to classification using color and texture features.
- Led to two publications: [conference article](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2013.562) and [magazine article](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9153130).

### Diploma of Technology in Electrophysiology - University of Chile

- **Institution:** Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile.
- **Year:** 2019.

#### Highlights:
- Explored biology and medicine from an engineering perspective.
- Worked on the processing of bioelectric signals and electrophysiology of sensory systems.

### Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering - University of Chile

- **Institution:** Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics, University of Chile.
- **Year:** 2010.
- **Thesis:** [Molds design for iris detection through Particle Swarm Optimization](https://www.cec.uchile.cl/~canavarr/Tesis/Navarro_2010.pdf).

#### Thesis Highlights:
- Proposed two methodologies for iris localization, one manual and one using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
- PSO methodology demonstrated better iris localization without relying on anthropometric information.
