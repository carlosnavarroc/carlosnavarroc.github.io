<div style="text-align: justify;">Hello there, my name is Carlos, and I'm a PhD and Electrical Civil Engineer interested in Image Processing, Pattern Recognition, and Teaching. My career has been developed around projects that involve high technology and innovation in automation systems in medicine, mining, and retail. My PhD thesis focused on detecting complex patterns using colour and texture features.</div>

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> Besides my project-oriented work, I have dedicated a significant portion of my career to teaching. Over the years, I have had the privilege of instructing diverse courses, ranging from fundamental mathematics and physics to specialized subjects within the realm of electrical engineering. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and expertise in image processing and associated laboratories. My commitment to education extends beyond the traditional classroom, and I am passionate about fostering a dynamic learning environment that encourages curiosity and critical thinking among students.</div>
